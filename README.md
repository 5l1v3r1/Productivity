Productivity
============

Productivity will be a Mac application that records key-presses in conjunction with the current iTunes song, which will allow it to generate useful statistics relating music to productivity. With Productivity, you will be able to figure out which songs make you the most productive, and much much more. Productivity uses useful abstractions, so it will be easy to incorporate different types of input besides the current iTunes song.

Status
======

Back-end currently under development. No User-Interface implementation as of yet.
